TODO
* put license into installer
* mention 'open source' in homepage
* separate modules for xtf.py and segy.py (or one module), upload to PyPI
* allow upgrade installation
* download dependencies with Python script, or bitsadmin-using batch file
* correct order of packets when writing CSV
* don't overwrite CSV, XTF, SEG-Y on internal errors (use PyGUI machinery?)
* use picket markers ('notes' packets pairs OR sheader.event_number)
* be explicit about endianess when doing numpy.frombuffer and numpy.getbuffer
* implement GUI.Application.display_traceback, then get rid of console window
* fix 'GControl is not defined' error (on key presses)
